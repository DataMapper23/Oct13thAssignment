        <p>Red-and-green Macaws are what most people think of when someone says parrots.<br>Though they can be mistaken for each other, Red-and-green macaws are distinct from Scarlet macaws where Scarlet Macaws do not have green colored feathers. Nonetheless, they have vibrant colors and are very cool to look at. As you may have seen in videos, they can also talk!<br> </p>

                There are different variations you may have seen of macaws including:

        <h2>Kakapo</h2>
        <img src=" https://www.doc.govt.nz/thumbs/hero/contentassets/22c4c0407c1142ffbd70ef6ff029d722/stella-the-kakapo-codfish-1600.jpg" width="400" height="150">

        Not much people seem to know that the largest parrot in the world is also a flightless one. The Kakapo is native to New Zealand where due to invasive species, is currently endangered. It has basically no survival instincts and freezes upon seeing any predators in hopes they don't notice its massive fluffiness. <br>And unlike other parrots, it is primarily a nocturnal bird, foraging in the night. Overall, this is definitely a unique and intriguing parrot that deserves attention

        <h2>Lovebird</h2>
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1634476825487-35567c1a7aa6?q=80&w=1770&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D" width="400" height="150">
    
        <p> Lovebirds are one of the cutest parrots ever (and not just because I used to have one as a pet). Like macaws, they come in different variations and come in different color combinations. <br> Like the name suggests, they often form long-life bonds with their mate and can even experience stress or depression-like symptoms if their mate passes away. They tend to make their nests in holes which can be in trees or crevices in the wild<br>While they can be aggressive, they are quite playful birds. Watch the video below to see them in action! </p>

            </tbody>

        <p>Well, this rating definitely has nothing to do with having a lovebird as a pet previously</p>
